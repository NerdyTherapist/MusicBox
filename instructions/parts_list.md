# Parts list #

This document provides a list of all necessary parts for the MusicBox. The basic design is from [adafruit][]'s [Babel Fish project][], there are links to their store for the parts that are absolutely required.

## Required ##
- Arduino: Adafruit METRO (ATmega328 16Mhz, 5V logic, USB programming, 20 digital I/O pins) →[shop][shop metro]
- Adafruit Wave Shield for Arduino Kit →[shop][shop waveshield]
- Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID Controller Shield →[shop][shop nfcshield]
- Power cable: **either** a 7-9V polarity protected DC **or** a micro USB cable
- an old, but **still working** speakerbox
- standard 3.5mm headphone jack (solderable)
- SD/MMC card
- Mifare classic NFC cards (1 is included in the NFC controller kit - there are also small round chips)

## Optional ##

### Moving the volume knob away from the board ##
This let's you choose a more convenient location for the volume knob

- 50k logarithmic potentiometer (like [this][ebay poti])
- soldering wire

### Closing the hole for the power cable ###
- Sugru or some other mouldable glue

### Protecting the actual speaker from careless hands ###
- perforated plate, aluminium or steel (looks like [this][perfplate image])
- (screws and bolts, or some other way to attach it - depending on your speaker box)

## Cosmetic ##

Depending on the condition of the boxand  how you are able to open it, you can leave it as is. But if it is going to be used by children, some colors will go a long way.

### Style idea: Marbling ###
- white base paint
- marbling colors
- shellac

## Tools ##
- soldering kit: soldering iron, solder, stand, wire cutter, etc.
- (drill)
