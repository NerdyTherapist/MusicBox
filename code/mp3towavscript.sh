# WARNING: This script has not been thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.
# USAGE: call the script and point it to a folder containing the MP3 files you want to merge and convert like so: "sh mp3towavscript.sh /path/to/folder". The script will produce a combined .mp3 file and a converted .wav file in the folder it's currently in.
# NOTE: ffmpeg is needed for this script to work. Download it at: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

# echo "$FILENAMES"

# concatenating all files

# converting the combined file
